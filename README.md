# Remote Desktop

##  What am I?
I am Remote Desktop, a simple Electron wrapper housing the (Google) Chrome Remote Desktop website.
In other words, I'm a simple, minimal web browser locked down to just the CRD site and only the CRD site. I'm also a native Windows app.

### Installation
To install, simply download the latest Master Branch and run the "Install Remote Desktop.exe" program within.
